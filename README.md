- **Models**: Llama 3.1 (8B parameters)

## Setup 🚀

```bash
# Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AjinkyaTaranekar/AiDevTeam.git
cd AiDevTeam

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the collaborative problem-solving script
python main.py
```

## 📋 Usage

1. Enter your problem statement or design challenge in the input field
2. Click "Start Discussion" to begin the AI team collaboration
3. Watch as different AI roles contribute their expertise
4. Add your own insights using the side panel
5. Export the final discussion and documentation as PDF

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Initialize the AI team with predefined roles
2. Generate initial perspectives on the problem
3. Conduct multiple collaborative rounds between roles
4. Create a solution collaboration graph
5. Synthesize a comprehensive High-Level and Low-Level Design
6. Generate implementation and resource planning recommendations

## 🚧 Current Limitations
