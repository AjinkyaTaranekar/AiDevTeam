# 🚧 AIDevTeam: Collaborative AI-Powered System Design 🤖

**⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS | EXPERIMENTAL PROJECT ⚠️**

## Overview

AIDevTeam is an innovative Python-based collaborative problem-solving framework that simulates a multi-role AI team for comprehensive system design and architectural planning. Using graph-based interactions and large language models, the project generates holistic solutions by leveraging diverse AI personas with specialized perspectives.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Multi-Role Collaboration**: Simulates interactions between different technical roles
- **Graph-Based Interaction Model**: Visualizes collaboration dynamics
- **Comprehensive Design Generation**: Produces High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD)
- **Logging and Visualization**: Detailed logging and network graph visualization
- **Flexible Problem-Solving**: Adaptable to various complex system design challenges

## 🧑‍💻 Roles in the AI Team

1. **Systems Architect**: Coordinates team efforts and ensures architectural coherence
2. **Technical Product Manager**: Bridges business requirements and technical solutions
3. **Security Engineer**: Provides security threat modeling and recommendations
4. **Performance Engineer**: Focuses on optimization and performance insights
5. **Unconventional Innovator**: Challenges assumptions and stimulates creative thinking

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies:
  - langchain
  - networkx
  - matplotlib
  - termcolor
  - ollama (for language model)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AjinkyaTaranekar/AiDevTeam.git
cd AiDevTeam

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the collaborative problem-solving script
python main.py
```

## 📋 Usage Example

```python
team = CollaborativeAITeam()
problem_statement = """
Design a scalable, secure configuration management system
that supports feature flagging for applications with over a million users
"""
team.collaborative_problem_solving(problem_statement)
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Initialize the AI team with predefined roles
2. Generate initial perspectives on the problem
3. Conduct multiple collaborative rounds between roles
4. Create a solution collaboration graph
5. Synthesize a comprehensive High-Level and Low-Level Design
6. Generate implementation and resource planning recommendations

## 🚧 Current Limitations

- Requires local Ollama installation
- Experimental AI-driven design generation
- Performance may vary based on the language model used

## 📄 Output

- Generates comprehensive design reports
- Saves detailed markdown reports in `design_reports/`
- Visualizes collaboration network

## 🔗 Related Projects

## 🌈 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add more sophisticated role interactions
- [ ] Implement more advanced design validation
- [ ] Create more comprehensive visualization
- [ ] Support additional language models
